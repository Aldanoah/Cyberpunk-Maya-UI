# Maya-UI-Changer

This tool allows users to apply various pre-made theme presets to enhance the styling of Maya’s user environment. This project is currently a work in progress as such aspects of the themes such as icons and menus may not display correctly.

Installation:
<br>
1) Copy the folder “MayaUIChanger” to your Maya Script directory. Usually located in the following path "\Documents\maya\scripts"
2) Launch Maya.
3) Open and run the UIPresetLoader.py script in the script editor.
4) Click on the newly added “Themes” item in the menu bar to make use of the tool.

**User Interface:** Launching the script adds a new “Themes” menu item to Maya’s menu bar. Navigate to it to cycle through the available theme presets.

**Optional:** You may navigate to the fonts folder in the script directory to install the optional “dejavu-sans” and “Rajdhani” font packs. These fonts enhance the look of the theme presets but are not required for their functioning.

**Note:** Please save the script to your shelf for easy access. The themes do not carry over between sessions and would need to be rerun upon the start of a new Maya session.
